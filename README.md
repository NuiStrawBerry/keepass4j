keepass4j
=========

An extended clone of KeePass4j (https://code.google.com/p/keepass4j/)

The original version of KeePass4j on https://code.google.com/p/keepass4j/ by 
Lukasz Wozniak was only able to *read* version 1 keepass databases.

I took the final version (0.0.3) from the original url and extended
it to be able to also create, populate and write version 1 files.
